## Introduction
This project presents a real-time feasible solution for road segmentation in Autonomous Driving Assistant Systems (ADAS), leveraging Ultralytics YOLOv8 and a novel approach to automated annotation. Building on the foundational work of the RS-ADAS project, this approach aims to address the real-time processing limitations encountered in the earlier system.

## Project Overview
The core of this project lies in integrating the powerful object detection capabilities of YOLOv8 with an automated annotation process. This integration facilitates the efficient training of a segmentation model capable of operating in real-time environments, a crucial requirement for ADAS applications.

## Object Detection with YOLOv8
YOLOv8 serves as the backbone for initial road detection. Its advanced object detection algorithms efficiently identify road areas within varying environmental conditions.

## Automated Annotation: autoannotate.py
A custom script, autoannotate.py, is utilized for automatically annotating the detected road segments. This script employs Ultralytics's SAM large model to generate precise annotations, which are then saved as .txt files.

## Training Ultralytics YOLOv8 Segmentation Model
The combination of the original images and the auto-generated .txt annotations are used to train the Ultralytics YOLOv8 segmentation model. This training process is tailored to enhance the model's ability to perform accurate segmentation in real-time applications.
