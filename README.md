The real-time processing capability ensures that the ADAS can make prompt and informed decisions, a key factor in ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles

## Future Directions
As we continue to enhance our road segmentation model for Autonomous Driving Assistant Systems (ADAS), our ongoing efforts are directed towards optimizing the model for even faster processing speeds. A key part of this optimization includes integrating additional data sources to enhance the model's adaptability and accuracy.

In line with this objective, we are undertaking a new project utilizing the ***Cityscapes dataset***. Cityscapes is a comprehensive dataset that provides a rich collection of images captured in urban environments, along with high-quality annotated labels for each image. These annotations cover various elements of urban street scenes, with a particular focus on roads. By leveraging this dataset, we aim to significantly improve the precision and accuracy of our road segmentation model. The Cityscapes dataset's detailed annotations will provide our model with deeper insights into complex urban landscapes, thus enabling more refined and accurate road detection capabilities in diverse environments. This integration will be instrumental in advancing the capabilities of our ADAS technologies, particularly in terms of enhanced reliability and efficiency in real-time applications.
